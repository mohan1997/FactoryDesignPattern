This project demonstrates the use of the Factory Design Pattern in Java by modeling a simplified banking payment system.
The application provides multiple payment methods (Credit Card, UPI, Net Banking), created through a centralized factory.
An in-memory database simulates account balances, and transactions are validated end-to-end.

The project includes:

Clean implementation of the Factory Design Pattern.

Banking domain terminology for realistic payment flows.

Unit tests to validate factory object creation.

Integration tests with an in-memory database to simulate balance updates and error handling.
